<h2 style= color:DodgerBlue;">Symptoms</h2>
<ul> 
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>Temperature above 37C</li>
	<li>Feeling feverish</li>
	<li>Fatigue</li>
	<li>Muscle or body aches</li>
	<li>Loss of smell or taste</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting</li>
	<li>Feeling very unwell</li>
</ul>


<h2 style= color:DodgerBlue;">How it Spread</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Respiratory droplets (spread by cough or sneezes)</li>
	<li>Physical contact (touching)</li>
	<li>Touching an object with the virus on it, then touching your face</li>
</ol>

<h2 style= color:DodgerBlue;">Vaccines</h2>

<h3 style= color:DarkBlue;">Pfizer Vaccine</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Given with 2 doses, 21 days apart</li>
	<li>People are not fully protected until 7 days after the second dose</li>
	<li>95% effective in preventing COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<h3 style= color:DarkBlue;">Moderna Vaccine</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Given with 2 doses, 21 days apart</li>
	<li>People not fully protected until 14 days after second dose</li>
	<li>94.1% effective in preventing COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<h3 style= color:DarkBlue;">How it Works</h3>

<p>
mRNA vaccines teach our cells to make proteins that will create an immune response without using the live virus that causes COVID-19. Once it is triggered our body then makes antibodies. If the virus does enter our body in the future these antibodies will help fight the real virus. <br>
When given the vaccine, your cells will read the genetic instructions and produce spike protein. Then the cell displays the protein piece on its surface, and our immune system sees that that protein does not belong there and begins building an immune response and makes antibodies.
</p>
